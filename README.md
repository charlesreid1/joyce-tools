# Joyce Tools

This repo contains tools for parsing/fixing/analyzing Joyce's texts. 

It primarily uses [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (`bs4`) 
and [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) (`re`).

To use BeautifulSoup on Mac OS X, you may need to run this first:

```
pip install lxml
```

## Portrait

The `portrait/` directory contains scripts for cleaning up Joyce's Portrait; see
[https://github.com/open-editions/corpus-joyce-portrait-TEI](https://github.com/open-editions/corpus-joyce-portrait-TEI).
